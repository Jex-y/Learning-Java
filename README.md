# --------- # UPDATES # --------- #
14nd - we do not need to do them all as the task only says 'up to where you are at'
14tf - I'm still going to a few more just so we are a bit ahead
14tf - I've cleared up some of the enums stuff and merged it into one file as most of it was repeated. Also added some comments here and there explaining things to some files + formatted them better
